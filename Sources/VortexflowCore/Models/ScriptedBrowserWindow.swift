/// Neither is reliable alone. Two windows of one browser can share a title — two blank tabs are
/// both "New Tab" — and on a laptop where everything is maximised, windows routinely share a
/// rectangle to the pixel. Matching therefore runs in passes, strongest evidence first, so the
/// unambiguous pairs are settled before the ambiguous ones are guessed at.
