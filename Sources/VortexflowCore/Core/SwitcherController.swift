/// Coordinates a single switch: trigger in, window activated out.
///
/// Everything stateful about a presentation lives here so the services stay
/// independently testable and the requirement traceability stays legible.
///
/// ## The latency path
///
/// Requirement 14.1 gives 150 ms from button press to a visible overlay. The budget
/// is spent like this:
///
/// 1. Event tap callback: reads one integer, hops to main. Microseconds.
/// 2. Window enumeration on a utility queue: the real cost, budgeted at 50 ms by
///    Requirement 1.2 and bounded by `AXBridge.messagingTimeout`.
/// 3. Back on main: order by MRU, load state, position and show the pre-built panel.
///
/// Thumbnails are explicitly *not* on this path. The panel goes up showing app icons
/// and captures land underneath as they complete (Requirement 9.2, 9.3). The panel
/// and its hosting view are built once at launch, because constructing them is tens
/// of milliseconds that the budget cannot absorb.
///
/// ## Why hover is polled
///
/// The panel is non-activating and never key, which makes AppKit's mouse-tracking
/// delivery unreliable for it — particularly while another button is physically held
/// down, as it always is in hold mode. Rather than fight that, the controller samples
/// `NSEvent.mouseLocation` at 60 Hz while the overlay is up and hit-tests with the
/// same `StripLayout` used to draw. The timer exists only during a presentation, so
/// Requirement 14.3's idle CPU budget is untouched.
