///
/// - `.nonactivatingPanel` plus `canBecomeKey == false`: showing the switcher must
///   not steal focus from the app the user is in (Requirement 13.4). If the panel
///   took key focus, the "currently frontmost window" that Requirement 8's dismissal
///   paths must leave untouched would already have changed by the time the overlay
///   appeared.
/// - `level = .popUpMenu`: above ordinary windows (Requirement 13.5) without sitting
///   above system alerts.
/// - `.canJoinAllSpaces` + `.fullScreenAuxiliary`: appears inside a full-screen space
///   rather than kicking the user out of it (Requirement 13.6).
/// - `hidesOnDeactivate = false`: VortexFlow is never the active app, so a panel that
///   hid on deactivation would never be visible at all.
///
/// The panel is created once at launch and reused. Constructing an `NSPanel` and
/// hosting view costs tens of milliseconds — affordable at launch, not affordable
/// inside the 150 ms presentation budget (Requirement 14.1).
