/// The switcher overlay in whichever arrangement the user picked (Requirement 3.1).
///
/// ## Why absolute positioning
///
/// Every card is placed at a rectangle that `OverlayLayout` computed, and those are the
/// same rectangles it hit-tests clicks against.
///
/// That is not a stylistic preference. The panel is non-activating and never key, so
/// clicks and hover are resolved by hit-testing a point against layout arithmetic
/// rather than by AppKit's view tree. Anything drawn at coordinates the layout does
/// not know about is, in practice, unclickable — which is exactly the class of bug
/// that made the drawer feel stuck, and exactly why the close affordance is drawn from
/// `closeButtonFrame(for:)` rather than as a `Button` inside the card.
///
/// ## No captions
///
/// There is deliberately no header and no keyboard hint. They described the overlay instead of
/// showing it, and on an overlay this short-lived that is noise.
///
/// One counter survives, in the hub: the number of windows the ring could not seat. It is not a
/// description of the overlay, it is the correction to one — the round arrangements are chosen
/// because they show everything at once, so the case where they do not has to be visible.
