/// The flying ghost of the window being switched to.
///
/// A throwaway panel holding the target window's thumbnail, animated from the card the user
/// clicked to where the window actually is. It exists only for the length of the animation.
///
/// Two properties matter more than anything else here:
///
/// - **It never takes input.** `ignoresMouseEvents` is set, so the click that started the
///   switch and everything after it goes where the user intended. A decorative animation that
///   swallowed a click would be far worse than no animation.
/// - **It never delays the switch.** The real activation runs before this appears; the ghost
///   is drawn on top of a window that is already coming forward.
